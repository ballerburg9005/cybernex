# cybernex

Warning: Development of this game has only just begun, only on Github for internal backup/colaboration.

# Licenses Source Code

If not otherwise specified in the file, it is GPLv3.

# Licenses Assets

Every picture file that has "x1" "x2" or "x3" at the end was taken from [Free Tech Dungeon Asset Pack](https://trevor-pupkin.itch.io/tech-dungeon-roguelite), and you are not allowed to reuse those files other than for playing/developing Cybernex in the shape and form provided here (however you are free to re-download and use the asset pack from the original author for any sort of game, as specified on that URL). All the other assets I drew and added in the same theme are CC0. At this point though there are no guarantees that this will always hold true to all picture files, until development of the game is somewhat more complete and things are weeded out.
