Every picture file that has "x1" "x2" or "x3" at the end was originally taken from [Free Tech Dungeon Asset Pack](https://trevor-pupkin.itch.io/tech-dungeon-roguelite) [(archived)](https://web.archive.org/web/20240210121432/https://itchio-mirror.cb031a832f44726753d6267436f3b414.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/upload2/game/1191395/9246084?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=3edfcce40115d057d0b5606758e7e9ee%2F20240210%2Fauto%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20240210T121416Z&X-Amz-Expires=60&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=b1c2080e4b41a9cc406cb006868a7f9aeb370099ac76f7c49ab108c568abaf01) and then modified to add more stuff. Generally speaking, you are not allowed to reuse those "x1" files other than for playing/developing Cybernex in the shape and form provided here (however you are free to re-download and use the asset pack from the original author for any sort of game, as specified on that URL). All the other assets I drew and added in the same theme are CC0. If you compare the archived version of the asset pack with the version in Cybernex, you can figure out which new tiles I added, which are also CC0. At this point though there are no guarantees that absolutely all pictures are CC0, as the game is so early in development who knows what stuff makes its way in there.
